A game made with pygame and python 3, the principle is to survive under a comet rain and destroy alien the longest possible. 

There is some things left i would like to add one day but i didn't have the time to implement since around 2021 :

- Allowing the character to jump by pressing Z or up key
- Make a ranking that is kept regardless the game have been launched or not (ie, saving & reading the scores in a file)
- Adding more monsters with more interesting patterns
- Make several levels instead of one

The game is fully playable regardless my unfinished goals stated previously.
